# Terms And Conditions Generator

### System requirement
Ruby 3

### Set up
Clone the repo on github and cd into it.

### Running the program
    $ ruby main.rb

### Running test
    $ ruby test.rb

### Design decisions
I choose to use an array for the body so that we can easily add more clause and section ids.

### Time taken
It took me about 6 hours 30 minutes to complete the program.

### What I would have done given more time
I would create another class to handle tags, instead of using just one class. I would also handle the parameters in a much better way instead of passing five parameters.
